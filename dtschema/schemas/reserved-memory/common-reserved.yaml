      This describes some common memory reservations:

         acpi-reclaim: Contains ACPI tables; memory may be reclaimed when the
           tables are no-longer needed
         acpi-nvs: Contains ACPI Non-volatile-storage data; memory may be
           reclaimed when the tables are no-longer needed
         boot-code: Contains code used for booting; memory may be reclaimed by
           the OS when it is running
         boot-code: Contains data used for booting; memory may be reclaimed by
           the OS when it is running
         runtime-code: Contains code used for interacting with the system when
           running; memory may be reclaimed if this code is not called
         runtime-data: Contains data used for interacting with the system when
           running; memory may be reclaimed if the runtime code is not used
